## Aegis Cognito AppSync Example
----------------------

A very basic AppSync (GraphQL) example API.

Aegis will work with AppSync to let you rapidly build GraphQL APIs.
It can import and export schema and resolvers. Those resolvers can
include Lambda handlers in your Go application.

To deploy run `aegis deploy` from this directory.
