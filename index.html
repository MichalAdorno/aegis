<h1 id="aegis">Aegis</h1>

<h3 id="an-aws-serverless-framework-for-golang">An AWS Serverless Framework for Golang</h3>

<p>Aegis is both a simple deploy tool and framework. It&rsquo;s primary goal is to help you develop microservices in the AWS cloud quickly and easily. They are mutually exclusive tools.</p>

<p>The Aegis CLI is not intended to be an infrastructure management tool. It will never be as feature rich as tools like Terraform. It&rsquo;s goal is to assist in the development of microservices - not the maintenance of infrastructure.</p>

<p>Likewise the framework is rather lightweight as well. It may never have helpers and features for every AWS product under the sun. It provides a conventional framework to help you build serverless microservices faster. It removes a lot of boilerplate.</p>

<h2 id="goals-philosophies">Goals &amp; Philosophies</h2>

<p>Knowing what Aegis <em>is</em> and knowing what <em>does</em> and <em>why</em> are different things. Don&rsquo;t use any tool or framework based on what it is, you
want to use one based on what it does and why it does it. More to the point, you want to use a framework if its goals and philosphies are
in line with your own project&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<p>Clearly, if you&rsquo;re still reading, your projects uses Go or you are considering using Go. Ok, but what about some of these other
considerations?</p>

<h3 id="devsecops">DevSecOps</h3>

<p>One of the goals of this project is to provide consideration for &ldquo;development security operations&rdquo; or DevSecOps. This is kind of an
extension of normal DevOps in that it also brings security into the fold.</p>

<p>A wonderful example here is with regard to managing sensitive credentials. Aegis CLI works with AWS Secrets Manager in order to help
you keep sensitive credentials, such as database passwords, protected. Aegis&rsquo; deploy tool will then insert those values into Lambda
environment variables or API Gateway stage variables. This prevents accidental publishing of credentials through version control,
CI/CD tools, logging, and so on.</p>

<p>Aegis also uses XRay by default to help you gain visibility into your stack, though you can switch it out for something else too.</p>

<h3 id="convention-over-configuration">Convention over Configuration</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a recurring theme in many solid frameworks. Complex configurations will slow down development and increase maintenance. Where it
makes sense, having sensible defaults and conventions is smart. For example, accepting any request through API Gateway to then handle
through a code based router is much nicer than configuring each route in API Gateway and then each handler in code. Simply ignore
(or handle through a &ldquo;fall through&rdquo; or &ldquo;catch all&rdquo;) the types of requests that aren&rsquo;t needed.</p>

<p>The handling of various events types through a &ldquo;router&rdquo; or pattern matching is yet another convention or pattern that you&rsquo;ll pick
up and use.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t completely avoid configuration of course. There is an <code>aegis.yaml</code> file afterall and AWS requires a lot of things to be
configured. However, where it makes sense, you&rsquo;ll see the convetion over configuration theme througout the framework.</p>

<h3 id="serverless-patterns">Serverless Patterns</h3>

<p>There are several approaches when building serverless functions and &ldquo;microservices.&rdquo; You can take the approach of logically
separating your Lambdas to handle all events for a certain service (like Domain Driven Design). Another approach is to handle
just one event for a service per Lambda resulting in many different functions.</p>

<p>Aegis allows you to architect your application in any way you like. It doesn&rsquo;t force you into creating one Lambda per API Gateway
route or per event handled. You can if you like, but you don&rsquo;t need to. You&rsquo;re free to come up with your own conventions.</p>

<h3 id="vendor-lock-in">Vendor Lock-In</h3>

<p>Yes, there is a little bit of that going on here. The decision to use AWS was made. A line in the sand was drawn. Though you
are free to cross that line in some cases. Just because your application runs on AWS Lambda, doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t use services
from other cloud providers.</p>

<p>You could decide to use bug tracking and logging from some other service if you like. You can use a serverless database like
CosmosDB on Microsoft Azure if you like. Nothing prevents you from this.</p>

<p>However, Aegis the deploy tool and framework will never allow you to use the same code to deploy either an AWS Lambda or an
Azure Function. The framework&rsquo;s goal is not to abstract so you can &ldquo;run anywhere.&rdquo; The reason for this is because the framework
would be far more complex and bloated if that were the case. It would also become a lot more limited too because some features
exist in one cloud provider but then not another.</p>

<p>So you&rsquo;re going to need to use Amazon here. There&rsquo;s just no way around it. <em>If</em> Aegis were to ever support another cloud provider
then there would be more of a &ldquo;port&rdquo; to another framework and deploy tool instead.</p>

<p>This also means that all core services are Amazon services. You won&rsquo;t find a service to work with any other provider in the core
framework. However, you might certainly find other Go packages to import into your application code to use other services outside
of Amazon.</p>

<p>Services can be injected as dependencies into handlers, so it&rsquo;s pretty straight forward to configure and use something from
another provider in your handlers with some sanity on configuration and code re-use.</p>
